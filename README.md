# Species Catalogue
Source code for a sample species catalogue using Javascript and Firebase.

This project was created because a friend of mine needed an on-line insects catalogue for his graduation project.

This project uses HTML and Javascript for front-end and Firebase for data storage, meaning it does not rely on any self-installed CMS.

# How to install
Just clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file and open index.html.

# Connecting to other Firebase database
If you want to connect to an external database, just change the lines in index.html file where the Firebase configuration is present. Please make sure you follow the same JSON schema being used in this project and that your Firebase database does not have public write permissions.

# Browser compatibility
This is a sample project and was only tested on Google Chrome and Safari.
